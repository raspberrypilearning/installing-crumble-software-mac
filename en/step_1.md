A window will open prompting you to drag the Crumble program file into the Applications folder.

Depending on your Mac's security settings, you may get a pop up window saying that Crumble cannot be opened because the developer cannot be confirmed. If this happens, Click OK.

In Settings, choose Security & Privacy.
